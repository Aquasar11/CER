He needs to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, so that's a total of 20 + 16 = 36 trays.

He can only carry 4 trays at a time, so we need to divide the total number of trays by 4 to find the number of trips:

36 / 4 = 9

" For a birthday party Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 6 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ",8.0,"To determine the total number of shelves Cody will fill up, we need to calculate the total number of sodas and then divide by 6.

Cody bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, for a total of 4 + 44 = 48 sodas.

Since the fridge can hold 6 sodas per shelf, and there are 48 in total, we need to divide 48 by 6:

 The schools debate team had 26 boys and 46 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make? ,8.0,"To find out how many groups they can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26 and 46, which is the largest number that can divide both 26 and 46 without a remainder.

First, let's find the prime factors of 26 and 46:

- 26 = 2 x 13
- 46 = 2 x 23

The common factor is 2, but since the GCD is the largest number, the largest factor we can use is 2.

However, we're looking for groups of 9. Let's check if 9 is a divisor of 26 and 46.

- 26 is not divisible by 9.
- 46 is not divisible by 9.

Since neither 26 nor 46 can be divided by 9, they cannot be split into groups of 9.

However, I must correct your approach. If we can't form groups of 9 using the numbers of boys and girls individually, we can try a different strategy. To split 26 boys and 46 girls into groups of 9 together, we need to find the GCD of their total number. 

The total number of students is 26 + 46 = 72.

The GCD of 72 and 9 is 9. 

Now we can divide the total number of students by 9. 
72 รท 9 = 8.

So the schools debate team can make 8 groups of 9 students together.",9,0.6931471507576225,False

The cafeteria started with 50 apples. After handing out 5, they have 50 - 5 = 45 apples left.

Since each pie takes 5 apples, we need to divide the number of remaining apples by 5 to find out how many pies they can make.

45 รท 5 = 9
