Q: A sequence of numbers is generated by starting with a two-digit number and repeatedly applying the following operation: if the number is less than or equal to 50, triple the number; if the number is greater than 50, subtract 20 from the number. What is the sum of all two-digit starting numbers that will eventually result in the number 100 after applying the operation at least 5 times?
A: Start by finding the possible values that can lead to 100 after one operation. If $x$ is the number that leads to 100, then either $x \\leq 50$ and $3x = 100$ or $x > 50$ and $x - 20 = 100$. The first case has no integer solutions; the second case has the solution $x = 120$, but 120 is not a two-digit number, so we ignore it.\n\nNow, we find the possible values that can lead to 100 after two operations. If $x$ is the number that leads to 100 after two operations, then either $x \\leq 50$ and $3x - 20 = 100$ or $x > 50$ and $3(x - 20) = 100$. The first case has the solution $x = 40$, and the second case has no integer solutions.\n\nNext, we find the possible values that can lead to 100 after three operations. If $x$ is the number that leads to 100 after three operations, then either $x \\leq 50$ and $3(3x - 20) = 100$ or $x > 50$ and $3x - 20 - 20 = 100$. The first case has no integer solutions; the second case has the solution $x = 80$, but 80 is not a possible solution since it will lead to 100 after two operations.\n\nThen, we find the possible values that can lead to 100 after four operations. If $x$ is the number that leads to 100 after four operations, then either $x \\leq 50$ and $3(3x - 20 - 20) = 100$ or $x > 50$ and $3(3x - 20) - 20 = 100$. The first case has the solution $x = 26.\\overline{6}$, which is not an integer; the second case has no integer solutions.\n\nFinally, we find the possible values that can lead to 100 after five operations. If $x$ is the number that leads to 100 after five operations, then either $x \\leq 50$ and $3(3(3x - 20) - 20) = 100$ or $x > 50$ and $3(3x - 20 - 20) - 20 = 100$. The first case has the solution $x = 20$; the second case has no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all two-digit starting numbers that will eventually result in the number 100 after applying the operation at least 5 times is 40 + 20 = 60 The answer is 60

Q: A regular tetrahedron has one of its vertices at the origin, and the three other vertices at the points $(a,0,0)$, $(0,b,0)$, and $(0,0,c)$. Evaluate the product $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{c}\\right)\\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)$ given that one of the tetrahedron's faces is a triangle with an area of 5.
A: We need to find the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the tetrahedron given that one of its faces has an area of 5.\n\nThe area of a triangle with vertices $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, and $(0,b,0)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ab$.\n\nGiven that the area of this triangle is 5, we can write\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}ab = 5 \\Rightarrow ab = 10 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0,0,0)$, $(0,b,0)$, and $(0,0,c)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}bc$.\n\nGiven that the area of this triangle is 5, we can write\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}bc = 5 \\Rightarrow bc = 10 \\]\n\nThe area of the triangle with vertices $(0,0,0)$, $(a,0,0)$, and $(0,0,c)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ac$.\n\nGiven that the area of this triangle is 5, we can write\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}ac = 5 \\Rightarrow ac = 10 \\]\n\nNow we have the system of equations\n   \\begin{align*}\n   ab = 10 \\quad &(1) \\\\\n   bc = 10 \\quad &(2) \\\\\n   ac = 10 \\quad &(3)\n   \\end{align*}\n\nSolve for $\\frac{a}{b}$, $\\frac{b}{c}$, and $\\frac{c}{a}$:\n\nFrom (1), $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{10}{b^2}$.\nFrom (2), $\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{10}{c^2}$.\nFrom (3), $\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{10}{a^2}$.\n\nThe product $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{c}\\right)\\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)$ is then\n\\[ \\frac{10}{b^2} \\cdot \\frac{10}{c^2} \\cdot \\frac{10}{a^2} = \\frac{1000}{a^2b^2c^2} \\]\n\nWe can find $a^2b^2c^2$ by multiplying (1), (2), and (3):\n\\[ (ab)(bc)(ac) = 10^3 \\Rightarrow a^2b^2c^2 = 1000 \\]\n\nThus, the product is\n\\[ \\frac{1000}{a^2b^2c^2} = \\frac{1000}{1000} = \\boxed{1} \\]. The answer is 1.

What is the value of $A$ on the factor tree shown?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-1,-.3)--(0,0)--(1,-.3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-2,-1.3)--(-1.5,-.8)--(-1,-1.3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,-1.3)--(1.5,-.8)--(2,-1.3),linewidth(1));\nlabel("A",(0,0),N);\nlabel("B",(-1.5,-.8),N);\nlabel("3",(-2,-1.3),S);\nlabel("C",(1.5,-.8),N);\nlabel("D",(-1,-1.3),S);\nlabel("5",(1,-1.3),S);\nlabel("E",(2,-1.3),S);\ndraw((-1.5,-2.3)--(-1,-1.8)--(-.5,-2.3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((1.5,-2.3)--(2,-1.8)--(2.5,-2.3),linewidth(1));\nlabel("3",(-1.5,-2.3),S);\nlabel("2",(-.5,-2.3),S);\nlabel("5",(1.5,-2.3),S);\nlabel("2",(2.5,-2.3),S);\n\n[/asy].
A: In this factor tree, A is the product of B and C, and B is the product of D and 3, and C is the product of 5 and E, and D is the product of 3 and 2, and E is the product of 5 and 2.\n\nWorking up the tree from the base, we see that:\n\\[ D = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\]\n\\[ E = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\]\n\\[ B = D \\cdot 3 = 6 \\cdot 3 = 18 \\]\n\\[ C = 5 \\cdot E = 5 \\cdot 10 = 50 \\]\n\\[ A = B \\cdot C = 18 \\cdot 50 = 900 \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\boxed{900} \\]. The answer is 900

Q: If $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ are the roots of the equation\n$$x^3+px+q=0,$$\nand\n$\\alpha+\\beta=-4$,\ndetermine $p$.
A: ## Step 1: Use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of the cubic equation.\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the cubic equation $x^3+px+q=0$ is given by $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to find the value of the third root.\nWe are given that $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$, so we can find the value of $\\gamma$ by rearranging the equation: $\\gamma = -(\\alpha + \\beta) = -(-4) = 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Use Vieta's formulas to find the product of the roots of the cubic equation taken two at a time.\nThe product of the roots of the cubic equation taken two at a time is given by $\\alpha \\beta + \\alpha \\gamma + \\beta \\gamma = p$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given information to find the value of p.\nSubstituting $\\gamma = 4$ into the equation $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$, we can express $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in terms of each other. However, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. But we can use the fact that $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$ to find the value of $p$. Unfortunately, the given information is not sufficient to find the value of $p$.\n\nHowever, let's try another approach.\n\n## Step 1: Use the given cubic equation to find the value of p.\nWe are given the cubic equation $x^3+px+q=0$ and we know that $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to find the value of the third root.\nWe are given that $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$, so we can find the value of $\\gamma$ by rearranging the equation: $\\gamma = -(\\alpha + \\beta) = -(-4) = 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of gamma into the cubic equation to find the value of p.\nSubstituting $x = \\gamma = 4$ into the cubic equation $x^3+px+q=0$, we get $4^3+p(4)+q=0$. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of $p$ and $q$.\n\nHowever, let's try another approach.\n\n## Step 1: Use the given information to find the value of p.\nWe are given that $\\alpha + \\beta = -4$ and the cubic equation $x^3+px+q=0$. Unfortunately, the given information is not sufficient to find the value of $p$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$. The answer is 4

Q: A biased coin is flipped 10 times. The probability of getting heads in a single flip is 0.6. What is the probability that the number of consecutive pairs of heads is equal to the number of consecutive pairs of tails?
A: We can ignore the first flip, since the first flip can never be part of a consecutive pair.  After the first flip, each of the next 9 flips is the start of a consecutive pair if and only if the previous flip is the same as the current flip.  Therefore, if the first flip is heads, then the number of consecutive pairs of heads is the same as the number of consecutive pairs of tails if and only if exactly half of the remaining 9 flips are heads.  Similarly, if the first flip is tails, then the number of consecutive pairs of heads is the same as the number of consecutive pairs of tails if and only if exactly half of the remaining 9 flips are tails.  Since there are an odd number of remaining flips, we can not have exactly half of the remaining 9 flips be heads (or tails), so the probability is zero.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number of consecutive pairs of heads is equal to the number of consecutive pairs of tails is $\\boxed{0}$. The answer is 0

Q: The set of all positive integers is divided into three subsets: A, B, and C. Each subset contains exactly one of the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. What is the smallest possible value for the product of all numbers in one subset?
A: We are given the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 to distribute into three subsets. The goal is to minimize the product of all numbers in one subset.\n\nTo achieve the smallest possible product in one subset, we should aim to put the smallest numbers together and leave the larger numbers for the other subsets.\n\nThe smallest possible product is achieved by combining the smallest numbers: 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value for the product of all numbers in one subset is:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{105} \\]. The answer is 105

Q: Ava wants to decorate her room with 120 stickers. She already has 32 animal stickers and 25 flower stickers. How many more stickers should Ava buy?
A: Let's compute how many stickers Ava already has.\nAva has 32 animal stickers and 25 flower stickers which adds up to $32 + 25 = 57$ stickers.\nSince Ava wants 120 stickers, she needs $120 - 57 = 63$ more stickers.\nThus, Ava needs to buy \\boxed{63} stickers. The answer is 63

Q: Find the largest positive integer $b$ such that $x^3 + b$ is prime for at least one integer $x.$
A: To find the largest positive integer $b$ such that $x^3 + b$ is prime for at least one integer $x$, we should consider the properties of prime numbers and cubes.\n\nLet's consider $x^3 + b$ and try to factor it or relate it to known prime numbers.\n\nFor $x = 1$, we have $1^3 + b = 1 + b$. This is prime if $b$ is a prime minus one, but that's not the largest possible $b$.\n\nFor $x = 2$, we have $2^3 + b = 8 + b$. This is prime if $b$ is a prime minus 8, which is a possibility.\n\nFor $x = 3$, we have $3^3 + b = 27 + b$. This is prime if $b$ is a prime minus 27.\n\nNotice that as $x$ increases, the value of $b$ that would make $x^3 + b$ prime generally decreases because the cubes grow rapidly.\n\nHowever, there's a notable case for $x = -1$ (considering the problem doesn't restrict $x$ to positive integers, but the solution will still adhere to finding a positive $b$):\n\n\\[ (-1)^3 + b = -1 + b \\]\n\nThis suggests $b$ could be one more than a prime number, but again, that's not the maximum $b$.\n\nConsidering larger $x$ values, we quickly realize that the only significant chance of finding a prime $x^3 + b$ with a large $b$ is with small values of $x$, due to the rapid growth of $x^3$.\n\nLooking at small primes and trying to fit them into the form $x^3 + b$, we can examine the prime number 2:\n\n\\[ x^3 + b = 2 \\Rightarrow b = 2 - x^3 \\]\n\nHowever, this won't give us the largest $b$ since we are looking for a positive integer $b$ and this approach will lead to negative values for most $x$.\n\nA more promising approach is to consider small cubes and what needs to be added to them to reach a prime number.\n\nThe cube of 1 is 1, and adding 1 gives 2, a prime.\n\nThe cube of 2 is 8, and adding 3 gives 11, a prime.\n\nNotice that adding a larger number to a cube to get a prime becomes increasingly difficult as the cubes grow, because the gap between consecutive primes generally increases.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the largest $b$ that makes $x^3 + b$ prime for at least one $x$. Given that, we should look for the largest possible $b$ that can be added to a small cube to make a prime.\n\nConsidering $x = 2$ again because it's the smallest $x$ that gives us a reasonable chance of adding a positive $b$ to get a prime:\n\n\\[ 2^3 + b = 8 + b \\]\n\nWe need $8 + b$ to be a prime number. The next prime after 8 is 11, which gives us $b = 3$.\n\nTo ensure this is the largest possible $b$, let's verify with another small cube:\n\nFor $x = 3$, we have $3^3 + b = 27 + b$. The next prime after 27 is 29, which would imply $b = 2$.\n\nThus, considering small values of $x$ and looking at the immediate primes following their cubes, we find that the largest possible $b$ that makes $x^3 + b$ prime for at least one integer $x$ is when $x = 2$ and $b = 3$. The answer is 3
