Q: the dimensions of a room are 25 feet * 15 feet * 12 feet . what is the cost of white washing the four walls of the room at rs . 5 per square feet if there is one door of dimensions 6 feet * 3 feet and three windows of dimensions 4 feet * 3 feet each ?
A: area of the four walls = 2 h ( l + b ) since there are doors and windows , area of the walls = 2 * 12 ( 15 + 25 ) - ( 6 * 3 ) - 3 ( 4 * 3 ) = 906 sq . ft . total cost = 906 * 5 = rs . 4530. The answer is 4530

Q: a rectangular field is to be fenced on three sides leaving a side of 30 feet uncovered . if the area of the field is 600 sq . ft , how many feet of fencing will be required ?
A: we are given with length and area , so we can find the breadth . as length * breadth = area = > 30 * breadth = 600 = > breadth = 20 feet area to be fenced = 2 b + l = 2 * 20 + 30 = 70 feet. The answer is 70

Q: the ratio of the length and the breadth of a rectangle is 4 : 3 and the area of the rectangle is 6912 sq cm . find the ratio of the breadth and the area of the rectangle ?
A: let the length and the breadth of the rectangle be 4 x cm and 3 x respectively . ( 4 x ) ( 3 x ) = 6912 12 x 2 = 6912 x 2 = 576 = 4 * 144 = 22 * 122 ( x > 0 ) = > x = 2 * 12 = 24 ratio of the breadth and the areas = 3 x : 12 x 2 = 1 : 4 x = 1 : 96 . The answer is 96

Q: a train running at 1 / 2 of its own speed reached a place in 8 hours . how much time could be saved if the train would have run at its own speed ?
A: time taken if run its own speed = 1 / 2 * 8 = 4 hrs time saved = 8 - 4 = 4 hrs. The answer is 4

Q: a fellow borrowed a certain sum of money at 5 % per annum at simple interest and in 5 years the interest amounted to rs . 2250 less than the sum lent . what was the sum lent ?
A: p - 2250 = ( p * 5 * 5 ) / 100 p = 3000. The answer 3000

Q: a train 360 m long is running at a speed of 45 km / hr . in what time will it pass a bridge 240 m long ?
A: speed = 45 * 5 / 18 = 25 / 2 m / sec total distance covered = 360 + 240 = 600 m required time = 600 * 2 / 25 = 48 sec. The answer is 48

Q: the population of a town increased from 1 , 62,500 to 2 , 62,500 in a decade . the average percent increase of population per year is :
A: solution increase in 10 year = ( 262500 - 162500 ) = 100000 . increase % = ( 100000 / 162500 x 100 ) % = 61.54 % â ˆ ´ required average = ( 61.54 / 10 ) % = 6.154. The answer is 6.154

Q: a , b and c completed a piece of work , a worked for 6 days , b for 9 days and c for 4 days . their daily wages were in the ratio of 3 : 4 : 5 . find the daily wages of c , if their total earning was rs . 1480 ?
A: 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 9 4 18 x + 36 x + 20 x = 1480 74 x = 1480 = > x = 20 5 x = 100 rs . The answer is 100
