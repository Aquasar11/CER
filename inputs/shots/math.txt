Q: In 5 years, Joey will be as old as Beth is now. If Joey is 9 now, how old was Joey when Beth was Joey's age now?
A: In 5 years, Joey will be 9 + 5 = 14 years old.\nWe know that in 5 years, Beth will be the same age as Joey is now, so Beth is currently 14 years old.\nTo find out how old Joey was when Beth was Joey's current age, we need to subtract the age difference between Joey and Beth.\nThe age difference between Joey and Beth is 14 - 9 = 5 years.\nTherefore, when Beth was Joey's current age, Joey was 9 - 5 = 4 years old. The answer is 4

Q: A sports conference has 14 teams in two divisions of 7.  How many games are in a complete season for the conference if each team must play every other team in its own division twice and every team in the other division once?
A: Each team in a division plays 6 other teams in its own division twice, for a total of $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$ games within its division.\nEach team in a division also plays the 7 teams in the other division once, for a total of $7 \\cdot 1 = 7$ games against teams in the other division.\nTherefore, each team plays a total of $12 + 7 = 19$ games in a complete season.\nSince there are 14 teams in the conference, the total number of games in a complete season is $19 \\cdot 14/2 = \\boxed{{133}}. The answer is 133

Q: Mark buys a loaf of bread for $4.20 and some cheese for $2.05. He gives the cashier $7.00. If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?
A: The total cost of Mark's purchase is $4.20 + $2.05 = $6.25\nMark pays the cashier $7.00, so the change he will receive is $7.00 - $6.25 = $0.75\nThe cashier only has 1 quarter (worth $0.25) and 1 dime (worth $0.10)\nSo, the total value of the coins the cashier has is $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35\nTo find the number of nickels Mark will receive as change, we need to subtract the total value of the coins the cashier has from the total change Mark is supposed to receive\n$0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40\nSince each nickel is worth $0.05, the number of nickels Mark will receive as change is $0.40 / $0.05 = 8. The answer is 8

Q: Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?
A: To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of blisters on the rest of Brenda's body.\nLet's break down the information given:\nNumber of blisters on each arm: 60\nNumber of blisters on the rest of the body: x\nTotal number of blisters: 200\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of blisters on each arm * Number of arms + Number of blisters on the rest of the body = Total number of blisters\n60 * 2 + x = 200\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n120 + x = 200\nTo isolate x, we subtract 120 from both sides of the equation:\n120 + x - 120 = 200 - 120\nx = 80\nThe value of x is 80. The answer is 80

Q: Monica way studying for an exam. She studied for 2 hours on Wednesday and three times as long on Thursday. On Friday Monica studied half of the time she studied on Thursday. During the weekend (two days) Monica studied as much again as Wednesday, Thursday and Friday combined. How much time did she spend studying in total during the five days?
A: Monica studied for 2 hours on Wednesday.\nShe studied three times as long on Thursday, so she studied for 3 * 2 = 6 hours.\nShe studied half the time she studied on Thursday on Friday, so she studied for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.\nDuring the weekend, she studied as much as Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday combined, so she studied for 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 hours.\nTherefore, the total amount of time Monica spent studying during the five days is 2 + 6 + 3 + 11 = 22 hours. The answer is 22

Q: What is $2343_6+15325_6$? Express your answer in base $6$.
A: We are given that the sum of $2343_6$ and $15325_6$ is $22112_6$.\nTo find the value of $X$, we need to determine the base in which the numbers are expressed.\nIn the given equation, $2343_6 + 15325_6 = 22112_6$, we can see that the base is 6.\nTherefore, the value of unknown variable $X$ is 6. The answer is 6

Q: Emily's quiz scores so far are: 92, 95, 87, 89 and 100. What score does she need to get on the sixth quiz to make the arithmetic mean of the six scores equal 93?
A: To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the score Emily received on the second quiz.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\nEmily's quiz scores so far: 92, X, 87, 89, and 100.\nShe needs to get a score of 95 on the sixth quiz.\nThe arithmetic mean of the six scores should be 93.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n(92 + X + 87 + 89 + 100 + 95) / 6 = 93\n\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n(463 + X) / 6 = 93\n463 + X = 558\nTo isolate x, we subtract 463 from both sides of the equation:\n463 + X - 463 = 558 - 463\nX = 95\n\nThe value of x is 95. The answer is 95

Q: What is the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{{1}}{{13}}$?
A: To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{{1}}{{13}}$, we perform long division:\n$$\\begin{{array}}{{c|cc}}\n13 & 0.076923076923\\ldots \\\\\n- 0 & \\\\\n\\cline{{1-2}}\n130 & \\\\\n- 130 & \\\\\n\\cline{{1-2}}\n0 & \\\\\n\\end{{array}}$$The pattern repeats after six digits, so the 43rd digit is the same as the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the repeating block 076923.\nSince the repeating block has length 6, and $43 \\div 6 = 7 R 1$, the 43rd digit is the same as the 1st digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{{0}}$. The answer is 0
