"In 2004, there were some kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. If there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006, how many kids came to the cookout in 2004?", 60,"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of kids in 2004 and then work our way backward.

Let's denote the number of kids in 2004 as 'x'.

In 2005, half the number of kids came as in 2004, which can be expressed as:

Number of kids in 2005 = x / 2

In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005, which can be expressed as:

Number of kids in 2006 = (x / 2) * (2 / 3) = x / 3

We know that the number of kids in 2006 was 20, so we can set up an equation:

x / 3 = 20

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 20 * 3
x = 60

Therefore, the number of kids at the cookout in 2004 was 60.

The final answer is 60.",60,5.770606164399563,True
"Karen is paddling her canoe up a river against the current. On a still pond, Karen can paddle 10 miles per hour. The river flows in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour. If the river is 12 miles long, how many hours will it take Karen to paddle up it?", 2,"To solve this problem, we need to find Karen's effective speed when paddling against the current. 

Step 1: Since Karen paddles at 10 miles per hour and the river flows at 4 miles per hour in the opposite direction, we subtract the speed of the current from Karen's speed to get her effective speed:

Effective speed = Karen's speed - Current's speed
Effective speed = 10 mph - 4 mph
Effective speed = 6 mph

Step 2: Now that we know Karen's effective speed, we need to find the time it will take for her to paddle 12 miles upstream. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 6 mph
Time = 2 hours

The final answer is 2.",2,6.431764398842982,True
"Bob is building a vegetable garden. It is 220 feet long by 120 feet wide. Half of the garden is going to be tilled land. A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?", 8800,"First, let's find the total area of the garden. 

Area = Length x Width
Area = 220 x 120
Area = 26400 square feet

Since half of the garden is going to be tilled land, that's 1/2 or 0.5 times the total area.
Area for tilled land = 0.5 x 26400 = 13200 square feet

The rest of the garden is what's not tilled land. The total area minus the area of tilled land is the area of the rest. 
Area of the rest of the garden = 26400 - 13200 = 13200 square feet

A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants. To find this area, multiply the area of the rest of the garden by 1/3 or 0.3333. Area for trellises = 0.3333 x 13200 = 4400 square feet

The rest of the garden that's not tilled land and not for trellises is the area devoted to raised beds. 
Area of raised beds = Area of the rest of the garden - Area for trellises
Area of raised beds = 13200 - 4400
Area of raised beds = 8800 square feet

The final answer is 8800.",8800,5.021617411232586,True
There is a playground that is surrounded by a square fence that has a side length of 27 yards. There is a 12 yard by 9 yard garden that has fencing around it. How many yards of fencing do the playground and garden have together?, 150,"To find the total amount of fencing for both the playground and the garden, we need to calculate the perimeter of both the playground and the garden, and then add the results.

The playground is a square with a side length of 27 yards. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4:
Perimeter of playground = 27 * 4 = 108 yards

The garden is a rectangle with a length of 12 yards and a width of 9 yards. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all sides:
Perimeter of garden = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (12 + 9) = 2 * 21 = 42 yards

Now, we add the perimeter of the playground and the garden to get the total amount of fencing:
Total fencing = Perimeter of playground + Perimeter of garden = 108 + 42 = 150 yards

The final answer is 150.",150,6.338901809891304,True
"Jill runs a business breeding llamas. Nine of her llamas got pregnant with 1 calf, and 5 of them got pregnant with twins. After they give birth, Jill traded 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas. Then she sells 1/3 of her herd at the market. How many total llamas  (calves and adults) does Jill have now?", 18,"To find the total number of llamas Jill has now, we'll calculate the changes step by step.

1. Originally, 9 llamas gave birth to 1 calf each, and 5 llamas gave birth to twins. So the number of calves is (9*1) + (5*2) = 9 + 10 = 19 calves. The total number of adults is 14 (9+5 pregnant llamas who gave birth to their babies). 
    Total llamas = 19 calves + 14 adults = 33 llamas

2. After trading 8 calves for 2 new adult llamas, Jill gets rid of 8 calves and gains 2 new adult llamas. 
    Total llamas after trading = 33 - 8 + 2 = 27

3. Then, Jill sells 1/3 of her herd at the market. 1/3 of 27 is 9. 
    Jill sells 9 llamas, leaving her with 27 - 9 = 18 llamas.

Marlon has a gift card for $200. He spent half of it on Monday and one-fourth of the remainder on Tuesday. How much was left on his gift card?, 75,"Marlon started with a $200 gift card. 

1. He spent half of it on Monday. This means Marlon spent $200 / 2 = $100 on Monday.

2. Now, Marlon has $200 - $100 = $100 left on his gift card.

3. On Tuesday, he spent one-fourth of the remainder. This means Marlon spent 1/4 * $100 = $25 on Tuesday.

4. To find the remaining balance, we need to subtract the amount spent on Tuesday from the remaining balance after Monday ($100 - $25 = $75).

So, Marlon had $75 remaining on his gift card.

The final answer is $75.",75,6.324524348873535,True
"Nina has four times more math homework and eight times more reading homework than Ruby. If Ruby has six math homework and two reading homework, how much homework is Nina having altogether?", 48,"To find out how much homework Nina has altogether, we first need to find out how much each type of homework Nina has.

1. Nina has four times more math homework than Ruby. Since Ruby has 6 math homework, we multiply 6 by 4 to find out how much math homework Nina has:
   Nina's math homework = 6 * 4 = 24

2. Nina has eight times more reading homework than Ruby. Since Ruby has 2 reading homework, we multiply 2 by 8 to find out how much reading homework Nina has:
   Nina's reading homework = 2 * 8 = 16

3. To find out how much homework Nina has altogether, we add the math and reading homework together:
   Total homework = Nina's math homework + Nina's reading homework
   Total homework = 24 + 16 = 40

"Gabby planted a watermelon vine, a peach tree, and two plum trees in the spring. Over the summer, the plants grew and produced fruit. She only got one watermelon to grow, but she got twelve more peaches than that, and three times that number of plums. How many pieces of fruit did Gabby get to pick that summer?", 53,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gabby got one watermelon from the watermelon vine.
2. She got 12 more peaches than the number of watermelons, which means she got 1 + 12 = 13 peaches.
3. She got three times the number of peaches of plums, which means she got 3 * 13 = 39 plums.

To find the total number of fruits Gabby got, we add the number of watermelons, peaches, and plums together. So, the total number of fruits is 1 (watermelon) + 13 (peaches) + 39 (plums) = 53 fruits.

Steve puts $100 into the bank. Each year he earns 10% interest on the money in the account. How much money will be in the bank after 2 years?, 121,"To find the total amount of money in the bank after 2 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the initial amount.

Year 1:
Initial amount = $100
Interest rate = 10% = 0.10
Interest earned in Year 1 = Initial amount * Interest rate
Interest earned in Year 1 = $100 * 0.10 = $10
Total amount after Year 1 = Initial amount + Interest earned in Year 1
Total amount after Year 1 = $100 + $10 = $110

Year 2:
Initial amount for Year 2 = Total amount after Year 1 = $110
Interest rate = 10% = 0.10
Interest earned in Year 2 = Initial amount for Year 2 * Interest rate
Interest earned in Year 2 = $110 * 0.10 = $11
Total amount after Year 2 = Initial amount for Year 2 + Interest earned in Year 2
Total amount after Year 2 = $110 + $11 = $121

"On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour  classes each day.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?", 272,"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we first need to calculate the total hours per week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each of 1 hour, so he attends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since these days repeat 3 times a week, the total hours in these days per week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes per day, each of 2 hours, so he attends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since these days repeat 2 times a week, the total hours in these days per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Now, we add the hours from the 3-day and 2-day groups to get the total hours in a week. 9 + 8 = 17 hours a week.

However, for the full semester, there are 16 weeks of school, so we multiply the total hours per week (17) by the total weeks in a semester (16). 

17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.
