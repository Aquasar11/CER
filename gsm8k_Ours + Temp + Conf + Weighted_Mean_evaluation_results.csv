"In 2004, there were some kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. If there were 20 kids at the cookout in 2006, how many kids came to the cookout in 2004?", 60,"In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. This means if there were 20 kids in 2006, in 2005, there were 20 * (3/2) = 30 kids.

In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. So if there were 30 kids in 2005, in 2004, there were 30 * 2 = 60 kids.

The answer is 60.",60,5.674204440768808,True
"Karen is paddling her canoe up a river against the current. On a still pond, Karen can paddle 10 miles per hour. The river flows in the opposite direction at 4 miles per hour. If the river is 12 miles long, how many hours will it take Karen to paddle up it?", 2,"To solve this problem, we need to find the effective speed of Karen paddling against the current. Since the river flows in the opposite direction, we subtract the speed of the river from Karen's speed to get her effective speed.

Effective speed = Karen's speed - River speed
Effective speed = 10 mph - 4 mph
Effective speed = 6 mph

Now, we can find the time it will take Karen to paddle up the river by dividing the distance by the effective speed.

Time = Distance / Effective speed
Time = 12 miles / 6 mph
Time = 2 hours

The answer is 2 hours.",2,6.614609533876339,True
"Bob is building a vegetable garden. It is 220 feet long by 120 feet wide. Half of the garden is going to be tilled land. A third of the rest of it will have trellises for vining plants, and the rest will be devoted to raised beds. How big will the raised bed section of the garden be?", 8800,"To find the area of the raised bed, first find the total area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is length * width, so the total area is 220 * 120 = 26400 square feet. Half of this is 26400 / 2 = 13200 square feet of tilled land. That leaves 26400 - 13200 = 13200 square feet to be divided between trellises and raised bed.

For the trellises, it's a third of the remaining space, so that's 13200 / 3 = 4400 square feet.

The remaining space, and thus the size of the raised bed is 13200 - 4400 = 8800 square feet. The answer is 8800.",8800,3.386283535562361,True
There is a playground that is surrounded by a square fence that has a side length of 27 yards. There is a 12 yard by 9 yard garden that has fencing around it. How many yards of fencing do the playground and garden have together?, 150,"To find the total length of the fence for the playground, you need to calculate the perimeter of the square. Perimeter of a square is given by 4 times the side length. The side length of the park is 27 yards, so the perimeter is 4 * 27 = 108 yards.

To find the perimeter of the garden, you multiply the length by the width and then multiply by 2. The length and width of the garden are 12 yards and 9 yards respectively. Perimeter of the garden is 2 * (12 + 9) = 2 * 21 = 42 yards.

Add the perimeters of the playground and the garden to find the total length of the fencing: 108 yards (playground) + 42 yards (garden) = 150 yards. The answer is 150.",150,6.300766036864554,True
"Jill runs a business breeding llamas. Nine of her llamas got pregnant with 1 calf, and 5 of them got pregnant with twins. After they give birth, Jill traded 8 of the calves for 2 new adult llamas. Then she sells 1/3 of her herd at the market. How many total llamas  (calves and adults) does Jill have now?", 18,"To find the total number of llamas Jill has now, we need to calculate the total number of llamas after the trade and then subtract the ones sold at the market.

Initially, 9 llamas got pregnant with 1 calf and 5 llamas got pregnant with twins, so the total number of calves will be (9*1) + (5*2) = 9 + 10 = 19.

Total number of adult llamas initially = 9 + 5 = 14.

After the pregnancy, Jill had 19 calves. Then she traded 8 calves for 2 new adult llamas. 

So, number of calves remaining = 19 - 8 = 11.
And number of adult llamas = 14 + 2 = 16.

Total number of llamas after the trade = 11 + 16 = 27.

Jill then sells 1/3 of her herd. 

1/3 of 27 is 9, which is the number of llamas sold. 

The number of llamas Jill has now = Total llamas - Llamas sold = 27 - 9 = 18.

The answer is 18.",18,1.9843506217976008,True
Marlon has a gift card for $200. He spent half of it on Monday and one-fourth of the remainder on Tuesday. How much was left on his gift card?, 75,"To find the solution to the last question, follow these steps.

1. Marlon starts with a $200 gift card.
2. He spent half of it on Monday. Half of $200 is $\frac{200}{2} = \$100$. 
   Now, he has $200 - \$100 = \$100$ left.
3. On Tuesday, he spent one-fourth of the remainder, which is $\frac{1}{4} * \$100 = \$25$.
   Now, he has $100 - \$25 = \$75$ left.

The answer is 75.",75,6.159917635469822,True
"Nina has four times more math homework and eight times more reading homework than Ruby. If Ruby has six math homework and two reading homework, how much homework is Nina having altogether?", 48,"To find out how much homework Nina has, we need to determine how much math and reading homework she has separately. 

Since Nina has four times more math homework than Ruby, and Ruby has 6 math homework, Nina has 4 x 6 = 24 math homework.

Since Nina has eight times more reading homework than Ruby, and Ruby has 2 reading homework, Nina has 8 x 2 = 16 reading homework.

Nina's total homework is the sum of her math homework and reading homework: 24 + 16 = 40. The answer is 40.",40,6.423773207176993,False
"Gabby planted a watermelon vine, a peach tree, and two plum trees in the spring. Over the summer, the plants grew and produced fruit. She only got one watermelon to grow, but she got twelve more peaches than that, and three times that number of plums. How many pieces of fruit did Gabby get to pick that summer?", 53,"To find the total number of pieces of fruit Gabby got to pick, we need to determine how many of each type of fruit she got. 

1. Gabby got 1 watermelon. 
2. She got 12 more peaches than watermelons, so 1 + 12 = 13 peaches.
3. She got three times the number of peaches as plums, so 3 * 13 = 39 plums.

Now we need to find the total number of pieces of fruit: 1 (watermelon) + 13 (peaches) + 39 (plums) = 53.

The answer is 53.",53,6.27687723181719,True
Steve puts $100 into the bank. Each year he earns 10% interest on the money in the account. How much money will be in the bank after 2 years?, 121,"Steve starts with $100. 

For the first year, the interest earned is 100 * 10% = 100 * 0.1 = $10. Total money after the first year: 100 + 10 = $110.

For the second year, the interest earned is 110 * 10% = 110 * 0.1 = $11. Total money after the second year: 110 + 11 = $121.

"On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour  classes each day.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?", 272,"To find the total hours Kimo spends in class:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes per day with 1-hour classes. That's 3 classes * 1 hour = 3 hours per day. Multiply the 3 hours by 3 days (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays), so 3 * 3 = 9 hours. 
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes per day with 2-hour classes. That's 2 classes * 2 hours = 4 hours per day. Multiply the 4 hours by 2 days (Tuesdays, Thursdays), so 4 * 2 = 8 hours.
- Now we have 9 hours from Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 hours from Tuesdays and Thursdays, so 9 + 8 = 17 hours.
- For 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo will be in class for 17 hours each week. Multiply the 17 hours per week by the 16 weeks in a semester, so 17 * 16 = 272.
